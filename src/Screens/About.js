      <h4> Hello, my name is Aviel Mutai.</h4>
      <p>
        I'm a student in Ariel university and this is the Final project of my study.
        My project comes to solve one of the problems that the students at Ariel University face.
        Many students live outside the city of Ariel and they do not own a personal car. There are few ways to get to the university because Ariel is not a central city in Israel, so it is difficult to get to and from the university every day. In addition, the area where the city is located is an area with a high level of risk and you cannot get on any ride.
        The most efficient way to get to Hand University is by hitchhiking, as there is no organized system that offers a convenient and useful solution. Until now the students would advertise themselves in WhatsApp groups. This road is difficult and will not go up at all and flying makes it difficult to find a comfortable and safe ride.
        My website centralizes everything required for the students. The site can only be used by students studying at the university, so security is paramount.Even students who are not connected to such and other hitchhiking groups can find what they are looking for very quickly with the click of a button.
        Hope you enjoy the project.

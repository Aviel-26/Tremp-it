# Tremp-it
My project came to solve a common problem of students in crowded cities in getting to university and in general.
The system is updated in real time about students who advertise themselves as potential ride.
The system work with FireBase databse and has a user interface and an administrator interface.
The user can manage information about personal trips, update personal details and search for a trip.
An administrative interface can block or allow users to use the website as well as cancel trips or information that does not meet the conditions of use of the website.
